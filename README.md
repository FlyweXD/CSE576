# CSE576

## Intro
In this repo, I included three computer vision projects when I took the [CV course](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse576/19sp/) from UW. Every project has several image processing functions you can use as a library.


## Feature
1. C++
2. Qt

# Usage
Project 1 mainly support basic convolution, blur, peak-fiding and color-based clustering funtions.<br/>
Project 2 mainly support corner-finding, homography matrix, non-maximum supression, RANSAC and stitching function.<br/>
Project 3 includes several helper functions of content-based image retrieval system.
